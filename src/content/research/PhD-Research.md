**A few things you should know upfront**:

1. Install Ghost.
2. Develop the site.
3. Deploy at Netlify.

## Next up, the editor

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: the Ghost editor. This is where the good stuff happens.

> By the way, once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Ghost** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
