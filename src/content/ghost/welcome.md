excerpt: Welcome, it's great to have you here. We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial getting started posts that will help you get familiar with everything in no time.

**A few things you should know upfront**:

1. Install Ghost.
2. Develop the site.
3. Deploy at Netlify.

Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our Ghost(Pro) service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern publishing.

The version of Ghost you are looking at right now would not have been made possible without generous contributions from the open source community.

## Next up, the editor

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: the Ghost editor. This is where the good stuff happens.

> By the way, once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Ghost** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
